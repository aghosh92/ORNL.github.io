**Abstract:** 
Materials behavior begins and ends at the atomic scale, making the understanding of how atomic systems behave of vital importance. Computational techniques such as molecular dynamics and density functional theory have become instrumental in quantifying how the properties of atomic-level materials systems propagate to larger length and time scales and dictate observed materials behavior. However, understanding the exact reasons for this behavior is often non-trivial, as the geometric and chemical complexity of these atomic systems created a near limitless number of configurations that drive the underlying materials properties. Therefore, quantifying which structural and chemical features of a material are more important than others is vital to understand why materials behave the way they do. In this talk I will show several recent advances in graph-based machine learning that have opened the door to better quantification of such features for applications such as corrosion, catalysts, and aerospace engineering. I will showcase the underlying mechanisms that make graph-based machine learning superior to more traditional machine learning techniques for atomic systems. I will also discuss the future of these techniques and how they can solve some of the most pressing challenges in materials science.

**Bio:** 
Dr. Chapman is an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at BU. He obtained his PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology and completed his postdoctoral work at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. His research expertise is on the fusion of data science/machine learning with atomistic/mesoscale simulations to better understand how materials properties change under extreme conditions. His current work emphasizes graph-based approaches to alleviate the small data and interpretability challenges of inverse design problems with a focus on corrosion imitation and catalyst design.
